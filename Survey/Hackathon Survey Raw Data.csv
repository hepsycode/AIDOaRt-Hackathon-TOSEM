We are of course very happy with (4) the PR generated by AIDOaRt and the collaborations as well. 

Some hackathon challenges were ""open"" to all partners, but some were specific with one partners, where we shared more sensitive data. So for us, sharing data is a question that came over and over again.

In addition to AIDOaRt hackathons, we have a similar event at the company. Each year in december, we have the event. First it was called hackathon, but later we changed name to be more inclusive with hardware people (hacking has a ""software feeling"" baked into the word). The company event is similar: people at RnD can propose projects, and after some filtration some are selected based on some criterias like applicability, follow a certain theme, etc. Then we work one afternoon and one morning (about 1 work day) on the project. Often this is combined with some inspirational speaker. So far, this company event has not involved external partners.",All,"As I wrote above, we have shared a lot of data publicly, and with these data sets, we have collaborated with anyone. But some data has been prepared specifically for one partners, who have signed some extra NDA -- and for this partner we have had ""closed"" challenges just with them (so two partners).

For the more ""open"" challenges, we have recruited partners at various work package meetings, and perhaps email lists. Usually, we have formed groups before the hackathon itself, but on the last one, we also added partners on the day of the event.

The collaboration has been a bit like children playing in a sandbox -- often we have worked on the same data, but next to each other. For example, I don't think we have coded together across partners, instead we have looked at data from different angles and tried to build a story together",Yes,"As use case provider, I think we often tried to define very open challenges. ","In some of our challenges we worked very closely with one specific solution provider, here they were very involved in the challenge definition.","We had very different skills, as use case provider, we often had a good understanding of the data and of the industry context, whereas the solution providers know much more about artificial intelligence, and the specific tools (e.g. python libraries) needed to tackle the challenge.","In the last hackathon we did something like this:
1 - we created an open data set with a specific type of data (time series data of quality metrics)
2 - we know that we want to learn about a specific topic (e.g. anomaly detection in this type of data).
3 - we tried to promote the challenge and recruit partners through work package meetings and to contacts we have gathered over the project.
4 - we became quite many partners in the hackathon, so we had an informal meeting over teams before the event, to make sure that everyone had the data, and had some initial ideas of what to work on during the hackathon.
5 - at the day of the hackathon, one new partners appeared.
6 - as use case provider, I was sort of the spider in the middle of the web, and tried to make sure that everyone got answers to any questions, and looked at something interesting
7 - towards the end of the day, I started collecting the interesting results from the partners, and I tried to make ""a story"" out of it. Sometimes it can be difficult to understand the results -- e.g. what is a long short-term memory neural network and how is it similar or different from a regular artificial neural network, and why can we expect it to be good at anomaly detection in our specific case?
8 - For the presentation, it's important to pick the best pieces from each partners and to make sure that they are all presented in a positive way. E.g., if a method worked very poorly this is not a failure from that partners, but an interesting and unexpected good lessons learned.","Yes, as use case provider, almost all solution providers are from a different domain if you like. Typically, these academics have very strong skills in AI methods, so we very much build together and complete each others skills.","Sometimes we had an ongoing collaboration and used the hackathon as a ""leap"" forward in the collaboration. In these cases, we knew a lot before we started. Other times, we were a bit surprised, e.g. in one data set we identified correlations between test case verdicts which we suspected were present, but we did not know that it was so ""easy"" to find them if you just work with the data in a suitable way.","Yes. Sometimes other teams worked at things that are of interest to us as a company, but not perhaps the exact thing we are looking at in this project. So we invited partners we had not collaborated with to explain a bit what they are doing in ""guest lectures"" over video chat. This has been appreciated by colleagues at the company.","Yes, we proposed one of two per hackathon. In the first hackathons, we used the same (or at least similat) challenge in consecutive hackathons.","We had data which we wanted to get explored, so we created challenges around the data.",Satisfied,No.,,,"Yes and no.

Also, I try to spend quite some time in practicing the presentation, and to be a bit engaging, involved and positive in the presentation and not to have too much text (images are good). 

I fear that many people with an academic background are good at writing papers, but actually quite bad at presenting. It is a valuable skill, and not something you should just do ""with the left hand"".","Yes, some small proof of concepts. Mostly the solution providers did this.

The same team kept working together within all other editions, following up on the solution and with some new participants to address specific problems found during the work.

In the 4° AIDOaRt Internal  Hackathon, the UC provider also included a new problem that part of the team started to work on.",Yes,Basically providing the information about a problem that was potentially solvable using the main technologies provided by the SPs.,"After the main problem description provided by the UCP, all the details of the challenge and potential solution was defined by the team working on the problem, refining and improving the challenge.","Working side-by-side with the UCP allowed the SPs to tackle the problem in a more informed way, using actual examples instead of just ideas and made-up use cases. So the development process was improved a lot due to the mentioned synergy. ","Since the problem provided by the UCP was defined all around the modernization of their artifacts to use MDE and AI, the steps were almost always. 

1) Look at the data (even when the actual data was not provided, we were able to create small versions of them).
2) Define which tools (from the range of tools coming from SPs) were suitable to deal with that kind of data
3) Defining how to integrate the tool (and potential auxiliary tools) in the whole framework, which means defining how to combine the MDE tools and AI tools in the direction of modernization of the provided data, giving back to the UCP a new version of the artifacts, but with augmented information and potential tools to automatize the process.","Yes, I worked closely with people who are more used to dealing with Systems Engineering rather than Software engineering. This work was essential to the hackathons since the UCP, in our case, was interested in a systems approach, so my contribution alone could not be the best fit for them.","For the 1° AIDOaRt Internal Hackathon, yes. In this case, I was confident that a single solution would be enough to solve (at least partially) the modernization problem provided by the UCP.

However, with all the discussions during the event (and in the following events) and the discussion group formed by all SPs involved, my idea of the dimension of the problem enlarged, which meant that the solution became much less clear and showed me the complexity of the problem.

At the end of the 5° AIDOaRt Internal  Hackathon, I finally saw a complete solution from the collaboration.","Yes, but I believe that not to a great extent.

The other challenges dealt with some very different problems, so the inspiration came mostly from the non-hard details and, indeed, from the synergy created around the Hackathons.","Yes, at the 5° AIDOaRt Internal  Hackathon, I proposed to change the frame of part of the problem to address a very specific situation.","Brainstorming (working together), Exploratory research (Interviews, Surveys, Questionnaires)",Satisfied,"Yes, mostly for 1 challenge","Mind mapping (the results of brainstorming are written on a whiteboard, paper, or flip chart, the common approach is creating sociograms using mind maps)",Very satisfied,"Yes, 1 challenge","Lo-fi & Hi-fi prototyping: Most of the interviewees said they do at least some sketches on paper, as in the case of 24-hour hackathons where many times groups have little time to prototype before development.

    - Rapid Prototyping

    - Boosting the team spirit: A sense of accomplishment and pride in their work, which can carry over into future project collaborations.

    - Accelerating Deliverables: Focusing intensively on specific problems the UCP provides.","The greatest challenge was the lack of actual (and updated) data from the UCP.

That is very relevant. It eventually meant changing requirements and some aspects of the technical solution, which became a bit more challenging. However, the net outcome is better as long as the solutions is potentially more eploitable.","In this project, the process was very incremental, based on successive versions of demos, where both SW and HW component were progressing from Mock/Placeholders to implementations, from EvaluationKits to Custom implementation. Hackathon was mostly used to show, discuss, correct and plan that evolution.","In this project we started to work and progressively reinforced our relation with the UCP, in the port domain.

However, the real dynamics is not allways a real hackathon.

Obvious issue is language barrier, but in general is always enriching.","The composition of the team, at least from our side, was shaped to fulfil our expectations (get advance at demo level, get feedback on exploitability, ideas on what to improve, etc). We have the impression that partners made the same and that worked.","Yes. We did not notice a specific help, althugh we do not discard it could have been in other scenarios",Yes.

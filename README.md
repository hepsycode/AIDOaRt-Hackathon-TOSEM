# AIDOaRt Hackathon Evaluation Repository

This repository supports the reproducibility and transparency of the research presented in the paper:

**"Foster the Use of Hackathons in Collaborative Research Projects: Methodology, Experience Report and Lessons Learned"**  
by Claudio Di Sipio, Romina Eramo, Vittoriano Muttillo, and Riccardo Rubei.

The study investigates the use of internal hackathons within the European collaborative research project **AIDOaRt** (AI-augmented automation for efficient DevOps, a model-based framework for continuous development At RunTime in cyber-physical systems), focusing on their impact on innovation, stakeholder collaboration, and project outcomes.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. `Report/`
This folder contains the results and materials related to the five internal hackathons organized within the AIDOaRt project between 2021 and 2024. It includes:

- Challenge definitions
- Team compositions
- Developed solutions and prototypes
- Evaluation metrics and feedback
- Reporting tools and data analysis spreadsheet

These materials showcase the methodology used to structure and assess hackathons as collaborative tools within large-scale research projects.

### 2. `Survey/`
This folder includes the results of a post-project questionnaire conducted among AIDOaRt participants to validate the proposed hackathon methodology and collect qualitative feedback. The dataset includes:

- Aggregated survey responses
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Charts and metrics visualizing participation, satisfaction, interdisciplinary collaboration, and challenge evolution
- Raw data and analysis spreadsheet (e.g., for Likert scale processing and open-ended response categorization)

The data supports the conclusions of the paper regarding the effectiveness and replicability of the hackathon-based approach in complex, multi-stakeholder research environments.

## üìñ Paper Abstract

In recent years, the growing complexity of ICT projects and the increasing need for effective multi-stakeholder collaboration have prompted the search for innovative methods to enhance project outcomes. This paper proposes a structured methodology for integrating hackathons into the life-cycle of ICT collaborative multi-partner research projects. Drawing on our experience with the ECSEL Joint Undertaking AIDOaRt project, we demonstrate how a series of internally organized hackathons can serve as effective tools for fostering stakeholder engagement, accelerating innovation, and aligning project activities with strategic objectives. Our approach involves a clearly defined process comprising a pre-hackathon phase for challenge definition, intensive hackathon sessions for collaborative solution development, and a post-hackathon phase for iterative refinement. Quantitative analysis of challenge evolution and participant engagement, together with qualitative feedback from a questionnaire survey, reveals that iterative hackathon cycles not only enhance technical outcomes, such as rapid prototyping and tool integration, but also promote sustained collaboration among industry and academic partners. The paper concludes with lessons learned and practical guidelines to support the adoption of our hackathon-based methodology in multi-partner research projects, highlighting their potential to manage complexity and drive innovation in the ICT ecosystem.
